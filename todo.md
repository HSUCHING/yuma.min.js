# TODOs

* ResizableBoxSelection: register the mouse handler on the window/screen so that it also
  works for mouse movement outside the browser client area
* Sometimes it seems the ResizableBoxSelection's (east?) handle gets lost -> investigate/fix!
* Seajax: when the mouse moves over a DetailPopup (even a hidden one) this currently
  triggers a mouseout event and fades the bboxes -> fix!
* CSS style for button active/focus
* Seadragon: Reposition/z-index should also work when switching between 
  Seadragon normal/fullscreen mode
* Host an "online API" somewhere so that people can try yuma.min.js
