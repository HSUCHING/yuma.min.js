# TODOs

* Seajax: when the mouse moves over a DetailPopup (even a hidden one) this currently
  triggers a mouseout event and fades the bboxes -> fix!
* There's quite a bit of code overlap between ImageAnnotationLayer and SeajaxAnnotationLayer
  -> should be eliminated!
* CSS style for button active/focus
* Seadragon: Reposition/z-index should also work when switching between 
  Seadragon normal/fullscreen mode
* Host an "online API" somewhere so that people can try yuma.min.js
