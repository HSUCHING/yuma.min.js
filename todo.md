# TODOs

* ResizableBoxSelection: register the mouse handler on the window/screen so that it also
  works for mouse movement outside the browser client area
* Dragging is constrained to the parent DIV, but resizing isn't -> change!
* Add CSS selectors on mouse over, so that annotations can be faded in/out or coloured
  differently when mouse is outside the annotated media
* CSS style for button active/focus
* .removeAnnotation for audio
* Annotation overlays don't reposition after browser window resize - fix! 
* Seadragon: Reposition/z-index should also work when switching between Seadragon normal/fullscreen mode
* Host an "online API" somewhere so that people can try yuma.min.js
* Add mouseover tooltips for buttons
