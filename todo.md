# TODOs

* The new selection metaphor had quite a bit of impact on the overall architecture - clean up/revise!
* Create nice demo pages for ETech
* Host an "online API" somewhere so that people can try yuma.js
* Add a nice mouse-hover transparency effect for annotation bounding boxs, similar to the Flickr style
* API: addAnnotation(annotation) method to programmatically load annotations
